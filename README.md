This project was solving the calculations of investments and interest being gained per month
I was able to do well with the different classes to help simplify the code and all corrections to be easily identified
I believe I could of simplified the Data more. Could of made the code more personal for me to understand and a little more diffeicult of someone to adjust.
The data was the most difficult part for me. Being able to create the correct calculations to get the right output. I was able to watch multiple videos on Youtube as well as ask other individuals I know that do coding ti help me understand an option to create that section.
I believe all skills will be transferable. Everything i have learned so far as been something new and different from my last class which has opened my eyes to different options of coding.
By having all the seperate classes made it easier to maintain rather then writing the code all in the same class.
